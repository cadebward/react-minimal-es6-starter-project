## Minimal React ES6 Starter Project

### Getting started

```ShellSession
npm install -g webpack # for the webpack command
npm install
npm start
# Go to http://localhost:8080
```

### Project description

This project aims to provide the **bare minimum** to get started with React in ES6.
If you've been frustrated by the massive size of other starter projects, this may
be nicer for you.  

This project **does not** have:

 * Hot module reloading
 * Production deployment example
 * Unit tests

This project **does** have:

 * React
 * Webpack
 * ES6 (via Babel)
 * JSX
 * Browser auto-refresh on code change
